# Positioning & Intro to Sass

Now that we've got some experience with displays and floats with CSS, we'll look at the positioning property: how it works and how to use it effectively. Along with display and float, positioning plays a key role in creating more interesting layouts with CSS.

We'll also take an introductory look at the Sass pre-processor. This is a tool that provides CSS with superpowers like creating variables, nesting selectors and easily importing other stylesheets. This is a fundamental tool for doing any modern web design because it enables your stylesheets to be more organized and expressive.

## Agenda

1. The `position` property and it's values
2. Positioning contexts
3. `top`, `left`, `right`, `bottom` and `z-index`
