3. Visualizing your repo
4. Branching
5. Merging
6. Resolving merge conflicts
7. Pull requests


### Class Mode

* I fork rainforest repo
* I add team as collaborators with write access
* Everyone in the class clones that repo
* I create a branch (add-review-validations)
* I make changes and commit to the branch
* I push the branch
* Everyone pulls the latest on master
* Everyone switches to add-review-validations
* Everyone switches back to master
* I merge the changes into master
* Everyone pulls again



### Group Mode

* Get into groups
* One person forks the rainforest repo
  * https://github.com/bitmakerlabs/rainforest
* Owner adds group-mates as collaborators with write access
* Everyone in the group clones the repo

* Divide up the tasks
  * Add validations to the Review model
  * Ensure that a Review belongs to a User
  * Add a view for showing all of a user's reviews
  * Add styles to the products#show view
  * Add tags to products

* Everyone makes a feature branch
* Follow the usual edit-stage-commit process
* When finished,
  * Switch back to master and pull to get the latest code
  * Merge your feature branch into master
  * If there are conflicts, resolve them first
