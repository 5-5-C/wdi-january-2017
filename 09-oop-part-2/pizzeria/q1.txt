Write a Pizza class

- Initialize pizzas with its ingredients. - To keep it simpler, disregard the dough type that we talked about yesterday.
- The behaviours of a pizza are:
  - bake
  - slice
    - Note that a maximum of *3* slicings can be performed.
	- Can an uncooked pizza be sliced?
  - eat - Can an unsliced pizza be eaten?
- Think about what kind of attributes (i.e. state) that you will need to implement these behaviours
